His music, while not technically “free jazz” (or even regular jazz actually), has that same sense of busyness that eventually coheres into a pulsing, living whole. Crucially, Ricca, who spends a lot of time thinking about the relationship between music and a good story, never loses sight of structure in his own music. His pieces are bustling, but they move and shift – showing a real understanding of tension and release.<br/></p>",
